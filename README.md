# dotfiles

Bootstrap your local environment in a single command!

This dotfiles repository is currently aimed for [**Ubuntu on WSL**](https://ubuntu.com/wsl), [**Ubuntu Server**](https://ubuntu.com/server), and [**Ubuntu Desktop**](https://ubuntu.com/desktop), tested against versions **20.04**, **22.04** and **24.04**. See how to get started with WSL [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-en/windows/wsl/install-win10).

It's also suitable for use in [**GitHub Codespaces**](https://docs.github.com/codespaces/customizing-your-codespace/personalizing-codespaces-for-your-account#dotfiles), [**Gitpod**](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/config-dotfiles), [**VS Code Remote - Containers**](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_personalizing-with-dotfile-repositories), or even Linux distributions that are not Ubuntu, through the [**minimum mode**](#minimum-mode).

Managed with [`chezmoi`](https://chezmoi.io), a great dotfiles manager.

### Minimum mode

The installation will ask if you want a **minimum mode installation**. The minimum mode only installs the needed dotfiles for the command prompt and is compatible with more distributions other than Ubuntu.

It will be enabled by default when running in a Dev Container or in distributions other than Ubuntu.
